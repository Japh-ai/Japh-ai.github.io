Seismic phase association plays a crucial role in earthquake detection and location workflows, linking seismic phases detected on different seismometers into individual earthquakes. This oral presentation at the EGU General Assembly 2022 in Vienna, Austria, and online explores the performance of phase association algorithms. Specifically, it evaluates the performance of the deep-learning based phase association algorithm PhaseLink by comparison with a traditional grid-based method and a small handpicked benchmark dataset. The study uses seismic data from the IPOC (Integrated Plate boundary Observatory Chile) permanent deployment of broadband stations in Northern Chile, focusing on the study of earthquakes and deformation at the continental margin of Chile. The research represents first steps towards an integrated automated workflow for detecting, picking, associating, and locating microseismicity in subduction zone settings.

Seismic phase association is a crucial task in earthquake detection and location workflows, linking individual seismic phases detected on multiple seismic stations to events. This oral presentation at the EGU General Assembly 2023 in Vienna, Austria, and online compares the performance of three different phase association algorithms. The study evaluates their outputs by comparing them with a handpicked benchmark dataset and by retrieving synthetic events. Seismic data from the IPOC (Integrated Plate boundary Observatory Chile) permanent deployment of broadband stations in Northern Chile is used for this purpose. The presentation discusses the evaluation of the performance of PhaseLink, REAL, and GaMMA associators, considering the number of correctly associated and lost events, as well as the number of constituent picks per event. The research aims to contribute to the automatic creation of large microseismicity catalogs in subduction settings and represents an important step towards improving earthquake detection and location workflows.

Hello there! My name is Jorge Puente, and I am currently working towards my **PhD in Seismology at Charles University**, in Prague, Czech Republic, focusing on the innovative field of **automatic earthquake detection**. This specialized area involves the crucial task of seismic phase association, where I utilize a variety of methodologies including **advanced deep learning algorithms**.

My research primarily revolves around enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of detecting seismic events through automation. By integrating cutting-edge machine learning techniques with traditional seismic data analysis, I aim to improve the speed and reliability of earthquake detection processes.

Since June 2021, I have been pursuing my doctoral studies at the [Institute of Geophysics](www.ig.cas.cz). 
I conduct my research under the guidance of my supervisor Christian Sippl, whose expertise drives my ambition to contribute significantly to the seismological community.

Additionally, my PhD is integrated within the broader framework of the [ERC project MILESTONE](https://www.ig.cas.cz/en/research/projects/2021-milestone/), a collaborative initiative that seeks to revolutionize our approach to seismic monitoring with new technological advancements.

My research focuses on two main areas: utilization of advanced automated machine learning algorithms for seismic phase association in large datasets, and analyzing subduction zone dynamics using microseismicity. This dual approach helps reveal significant patterns and insights into Earth's subsurface processes.
